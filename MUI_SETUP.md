# Material-UI Setup

This project has been configured with Material-UI (MUI) for modern React components.

## Installed Packages

- `@mui/material` - Core Material-UI components
- `@emotion/react` - CSS-in-JS library (required by MUI)

- `@mui/icons-material` - Material Design icons

## Project Structure

- `src/theme.ts` - Material-UI theme configuration
- `src/App.tsx` - Main app component with ThemeProvider

import { Home as HomeIcon } from '@mui/icons-material';
```

## Next Steps
